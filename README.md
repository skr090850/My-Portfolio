# Suraj Kumar - Portfolio (React + Vite)

This is the repository for my personal portfolio website, built using React and Vite. This project provides a fast, modern development experience with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and is styled using Tailwind CSS.

## Tech Stack & Key Libraries

This project is built with a modern frontend stack:

-   **Framework:** [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
-   **Build Tool:** [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
-   **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
-   **Icons:** [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)

This setup uses Vite's official React plugin, which leverages Babel for Fast Refresh during development.

## Local Development

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps.

**1. Clone the repository:**

```sh
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
cd your-repo-name
```

**2. Install dependencies:**

This project uses `npm` for package management.

```sh
npm install
```

**3. Run the development server:**

This command will start the Vite development server with HMR enabled.

```sh
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Building for Production

To create an optimized production build, run the following command:

```sh
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` directory with the static assets, which can then be deployed to any static hosting service.
